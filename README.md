# Discordex

Discord API for Elixir

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add discordex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
        def deps do
          [{:discordex, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end
```

  2. Ensure discordex is started before your application:

```elixir
        def application do
          [applications: [:discordex]]
        end
```
